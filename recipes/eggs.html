        <h2>About the recipe!</h2>
        <p>
            This is my go-to breakfast for a protein-filled start to
            the day. Scrambled eggs are a personal staple of mine 
            at the moment, because it's such a quick and easy way to 
            get nutrients that are vital to bulking and building muscle.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/8 cup shredded pepper jack, or similar cheese</li>
            <li>garlic powder, to taste</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add butter to pan and heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Once butter has melted and spread, add eggs,
                salt, and pepper, and whisk in pan until consistent.</li>
            <li>Let sit for 30-40 seconds, and whisk again. Repeat
                this throughout the process.</li>
            <li>Once eggs are about 50% cooked, add cheese and 
                small amount of garlic powder, and continue whisking.
                The process should take about 3 minutes total.</li>
