        <h2>About the recipe!</h2>
        <p1>
            This recipe has been a staple in my family for years!
            I still remember, oh, it seems like eons ago, waking 
            up on sunny weekend mornings at Aunt Bertha's farm out 
            East to the smell of these quick-rising cinnamon rolls.
            My sisters and I would race downstairs as soon as we heard
            the oven go off and compete to see who would get the ones
            in the middle (they were the gooiest!!).

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles,
                then remove from heat. Mix in margarine; stir until
                melted. Let cool until lukewarm.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/4 cup flour, 
                yeast, white sugar and salt; mix well. Add water, 
                egg and the milk mixture; beat well. Add the 
                remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well 
                after each addition. When the dough has just 
                pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly 
                floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest 
                for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix 
                together brown sugar, cinnamon, softened 
                margarine.</li>
            <li>Roll out dough into a 12x9 inch rectangle. 
                Spread dough with margarine/sugar mixture. 
                Sprinkle with raisins if desired. Roll up dough 
                and pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 equal size 
                rolls and place cut side up in 12 lightly greased 
                muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, 
                about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F 
                (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or 
                until browned. Remove from muffin cups to cool. 
                Serve warm</li>
        </ol>
