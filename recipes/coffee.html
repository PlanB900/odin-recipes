        <h2>About my coffee!</h2>
        <p>
            I've been a semi-regular coffee drinker since I first 
            tried it back in middle school. Not obsessive, since 
            I still have a somewhat irrational fear of the effects
            of caffeine (don't ask... I still dont understand why
            either). After working in coffee shops for about a year
            and a half now, my favorite coffee drink is still just a 
            simple cup of drip with a small bit of cream or milk.
            Here's the routine I use to make it in the morning!
        </p>

        <h3>What I use:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mr. Coffee 5-cup drip coffee machine</li>
            <li>Small coffee filters</li>
            <li>Cuisinart small coffee grinder</li>
            <li>Starbucks Odyssey whole coffee beans</li>
            <li>1 tbsp whole milk or half and half</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour coffee beans into the small coffe grinder,
                fill about halfway.</li>
            <li>Grind for roughly 10 seconds, releasing the 
                power about 4-5 times to allow the beans to settle
                and move around.</li>
            <li>Add a filter to the top of the coffee machine,
                and add the coffee grounds, one tablespoon at a time.
                <em>note: it doesn't necessarily matter how many
                    tablespoons you add, but for every tablespoon
                    you will add 3 oz of water. I like to do 8 
                    tablespoons, which makes 3 cups of 
                    coffee.</em></li>
            <li>Add water to the back of the machine, three times
                as many tbsp coffee you added, in ounces.</li>
            <li>Press "brew" on the machine.</li>
            <li>When it is done, pour into your favorite mug
                and add your milk or cream! Enjoy.</li>    

        </ol>
